# Fan-Fan-Xiang-Qi-aka-Reverse-Chess
A game based on chinese chess. Programing based on SFML

The program need to be run by Visual Studio (best version: 2019), under Windows environment.
Before running the program, you need first download SFML on your computer and correctly disposed it.

The online function was not finished (and maybe will not be finished).

The program part was made all by myself.

And the images or the music was made (found) by the classmates of mine.
I have no copyright on them.
